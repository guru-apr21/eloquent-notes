## Values, types and operators

### Numbers
Javascript uses a fixes number of bits, 64 of them

### Arithmetic
'+' and '-' has the same level of **precendence**. The same goes for '*' and '/'. When multiple operator with the same precendence level appear next to each other, the calculations happens from left to right.
Another operator in javascript arithmetic is %, the reminder operator. X % Y It provides the reminder of X divided by Y. It is sometimes called modulo.

### Special numbers
There are three special values in javascript whole value type is number but doesn't behave like normal numbers. -Infinity, Infinity, Nan - **Not a number**.  
Nan is resulted when an arithmetic operation yields unmeaningfull value. There is only one value in javascript which is not equal to itself- Nan
